      <h3>HTML Introduction</h3>
      <p id="Introduction">
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language.
        HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.
        HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.
      </p>

      <p id="Basics">
      <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every HTML document begins with a HTML document tag. Although this is not mandatory, it is a good convention to start the document with this below-mentioned tag.
          Please refer to the HTML Doctypes article for more information related to Doctypes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic HTML tags.
          It begins with <html> and ends with

          </html> tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or documents like the title of the page and other miscellaneous information. This information is enclosed within the head tag which opens with

          <head> and ends with </head>.
          The contents will of this tag will be explained in the later sections of the course.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can mention the title of a web page using the title tag.
          This is header information and hence is mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with title and ends with title.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with

          <body> and ends with </body>.
          All content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be it writings or images or audio or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may insert mentioned contents into our web pages.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p id="Elements">
      <h3>HTML Elements</h3>
      HTML Element: The HTML element consist of 3 parts.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Opening tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material starts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Closing tag: It is used to tell the browser where the content material ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content: It is the actual content material inside the opening and closing tag.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Combining all these 3 parts results in an overall HTML Element.
      </p>


      <p id="Headings">
      <h3>HTML Heading</h3>
      There are six levels of headings defined by HTML.
      These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>h1</strong> is used for the main heading. (Biggest in size)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>h2</strong> is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under the subheadings then the elements are used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>h6</strong>for the small heading (smallest one).
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      <p id="Links">
      <h3>HTML Links</h3>
      It is a connection from one web resource to another. A link has two ends, An anchor and direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource such as an image, a video clip, a
      sound bite, a program, an HTML document or an element within an HTML document. You will find many websites or social media platforms ( Like YouTube, Instagram ) which link an image to a URL or a text to a URL etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      This basically means that by using the ‘a’ tag, you can link 1 element of the code to another element that may/may not be in your code.
      <h4>HTML Link Syntax</h4>
      Links are specified in HTML using the “a” tag.

        <br>
        <br>
        There are 2 ways to insert the images into a webpage:

        <ul>
          <li>
            By providing a full path or address (URL) to access an internet file.
          </li>
          <li>
            By providing the file path relative to the location of the current web page file.

        </ul>
        </p>


        <p id="Tags">
        <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
        <strong>Doctype</strong>A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written.
        The Doctype is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.

        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Declaration of a Doctype</strong>A DOCTYPE declaration appears at the top of a web page before all other elements. According to the HTML specification or standards, every HTML document requires a document type declaration to ensure
        that the pages are displayed in the way they are intended to be displayed.
        </p>


        <p id="Attributes">
        <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
        In this article, we will know HTML Attributes, their implementation through the examples. All HTML elements have attributes that will provide additional information about that particular element. It takes 2 parameters, ie, a name & a value
        which define the properties of the element and are placed inside the element tag.
        <br>
        <br>
        The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the properties value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element. Every name has some value that must be
        written within quotes.
